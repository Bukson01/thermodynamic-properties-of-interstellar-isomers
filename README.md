# About Dataset
The data provided in each of the corresponding file, contains the partition functions and its values which we used to analyze and observe the results obtained.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on using the matlab inbuilt functions to perform descriptive analysis on the dataset provided in the corresponding files - to determine entropic and free energy values. Also, to look at the relationship between temperature, entropy and free energy using the partition function.

# Running the program
You can open the files except 'README.md' using Matlab. To run the program, I use MATLAB R2018b on a Windows 10 machine.

# Requirements 
*Language: MATLAB R2018b or above.

# Project Data 
The data region of each isomer is contained in the file with the corresponding group of isomers (G4 = group 4 and G5 = group 5)

# Built with
MATLAB R2018b  - The language used to develop this. 

# Author
@Bukson01 - Sole author for this program. Mentioned all the help received in 'Acknowledgements' section.
